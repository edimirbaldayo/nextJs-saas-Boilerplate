# Technical Decisions Log

## 2024-01-11: Component Architecture Refactoring

### Decision
Refactored the large Users page into separate, focused components for better maintainability and code organization.

### Context
The Users page had grown to over 400 lines with three different management interfaces (Users, Roles, Permissions) all in one file, making it difficult to maintain and understand.

### Options Considered
1. **Keep everything in one file** - Would continue to grow and become unmaintainable
2. **Split into separate pages** - Would require additional routing and navigation complexity
3. **Split into separate components** - Maintains single-page experience while improving code organization

### Chosen Solution
Split the Users page into three separate components:
- `UsersTab` - Handles user management functionality
- `RolesTab` - Handles role management functionality  
- `PermissionsTab` - Handles permission management functionality

### Implementation Details
- Created `src/components/user-management/` directory
- Each component has its own state, forms, and API calls
- Main Users page orchestrates the components and handles success/error messages
- Used index file for clean imports: `import { UsersTab, RolesTab, PermissionsTab } from "@/components/user-management"`

### Benefits
- **Maintainability**: Each component is focused and easier to understand
- **Reusability**: Components can be reused in other contexts if needed
- **Testing**: Easier to write unit tests for individual components
- **Developer Experience**: Better code organization and separation of concerns

### Trade-offs
- **Slight complexity increase**: Need to manage component communication
- **More files**: Increased file count but better organization

## 2024-01-11: Manage Permissions Implementation

### Decision
Implemented the "Manage Permissions" functionality for roles with a modal interface for assigning/unassigning permissions.

### Context
The "Manage Permissions" button in the roles tab was non-functional, and users needed a way to assign specific permissions to roles.

### Options Considered
1. **Separate page** - Would require additional routing
2. **Inline editing** - Would make the table complex and hard to use
3. **Modal interface** - Provides focused interaction without navigation

### Chosen Solution
Modal-based interface with checkboxes for all available permissions, showing which ones are currently assigned to the role.

### Implementation Details
- **API Endpoint**: Added GET method to `/api/v1/roles/[roleId]/permissions/route.ts` to fetch all permissions and current assignments
- **Frontend State**: Added permissions management state to `RolesTab` component
- **UI Components**: 
  - Modal with scrollable permission list
  - Checkboxes for each permission with clear labels
  - Save/Cancel buttons with loading states
- **API Integration**: 
  - POST to assign permissions
  - DELETE to unassign permissions
  - Efficient diff-based updates (only changes what's necessary)

### Benefits
- **User-friendly**: Clear visual interface for permission management
- **Efficient**: Only updates changed permissions
- **Consistent**: Follows existing modal patterns in the application
- **Scalable**: Can handle large numbers of permissions with scrolling

### Trade-offs
- **Modal complexity**: Additional state management for the modal
- **API calls**: Multiple API calls for fetching and updating permissions

## 2024-01-10: Tabbed Interface for User Management

### Decision
Consolidated Users, Roles, and Permissions management into a single tabbed interface instead of separate pages.

### Context
Originally had separate pages for Users (`/dashboard/users`), Roles (`/dashboard/roles`), and Permissions (`/dashboard/permissions`), which created navigation complexity and inconsistent user experience.

### Options Considered
1. **Keep separate pages** - Maintains separation but requires more navigation
2. **Single page with tabs** - Consolidates functionality in one place
3. **Dashboard widgets** - Would be too limited for full CRUD operations

### Chosen Solution
Single page with tabbed interface using shadcn/ui Tabs component, consolidating all user-related management into `/dashboard/users`.

### Implementation Details
- Used `Tabs`, `TabsList`, `TabsTrigger`, and `TabsContent` from shadcn/ui
- Each tab contains full CRUD functionality for its respective entity
- Maintained all existing API endpoints and functionality
- Added success/error message handling at the page level

### Benefits
- **Better UX**: All related functionality in one place
- **Reduced navigation**: No need to switch between pages
- **Consistent interface**: Same patterns across all management areas
- **Mobile-friendly**: Tabs work well on mobile devices

### Trade-offs
- **Larger page**: More content in one view
- **State management**: Need to manage state for multiple tabs

## 2024-01-09: Authentication Strategy

### Decision
Implemented NextAuth.js with credentials provider for authentication, including password reset functionality.

### Context
Needed a secure, production-ready authentication system that supports both local development and potential future OAuth providers.

### Options Considered
1. **Custom authentication** - Full control but more development time
2. **NextAuth.js** - Battle-tested, extensible, good Next.js integration
3. **Auth0** - Managed service but adds external dependency

### Chosen Solution
NextAuth.js with credentials provider, custom password reset flow, and role-based access control.

### Implementation Details
- **Session Management**: JWT-based sessions with secure cookies
- **Password Reset**: Custom implementation with secure tokens and email integration
- **Role-based Access**: Custom middleware for protecting routes and API endpoints
- **Database Integration**: Prisma models for users, roles, and permissions

### Benefits
- **Security**: Industry-standard authentication patterns
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add OAuth providers later
- **Integration**: Seamless Next.js integration
- **Customization**: Full control over authentication flow

### Trade-offs
- **Complexity**: More setup required than managed services
- **Maintenance**: Need to handle security updates and best practices

## 2024-01-08: UI Component Library Choice

### Decision
Selected shadcn/ui as the primary UI component library for the dashboard.

### Context
Needed a modern, accessible, and customizable component library that works well with Next.js and TypeScript.

### Options Considered
1. **Material-UI (MUI)** - Comprehensive but heavy and opinionated
2. **Ant Design** - Feature-rich but less customizable
3. **shadcn/ui** - Modern, customizable, Tailwind-based
4. **Custom components** - Full control but significant development time

### Chosen Solution
shadcn/ui with Tailwind CSS for styling and Radix UI for accessibility.

### Implementation Details

## 2024-01-07: Database Schema Design

### Decision
Designed a normalized database schema with separate User, Role, and Permission models using many-to-many relationships.

### Context
Needed a flexible role-based access control (RBAC) system that could handle complex permission scenarios.

### Options Considered
1. **Simple user-role relationship** - Limited flexibility
2. **Role-permission relationship** - More flexible but complex
3. **User-permission relationship** - Maximum flexibility but harder to manage

### Chosen Solution
Three-tier RBAC system: Users → Roles → Permissions with junction tables for many-to-many relationships.

### Implementation Details
- **User Model**: Core user information with isActive flag
- **Role Model**: Named roles with descriptions and active status
- **Permission Model**: Granular permissions with resource and action
- **Junction Tables**: UserRole and RolePermission for relationships
- **Cascade Deletes**: Proper cleanup when users/roles are deleted

### Benefits
- **Flexibility**: Can assign multiple roles to users and multiple permissions to roles
- **Scalability**: Can handle complex permission scenarios
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Performance**: Efficient queries with proper indexing

### Trade-offs
- **Complexity**: More complex than simple user-role relationships
- **Query Complexity**: Some queries require joins across multiple tables
